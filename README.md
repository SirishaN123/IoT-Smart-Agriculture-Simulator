# IoT-Smart-Agriculture-Simulator
"A Python-based IoT Smart Agriculture simulation that generates real-time sensor data (temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and light), visualizes environmental trends, and triggers smart alerts for critical conditions. This project demonstrates IoT concepts, data streaming, and smart farming applications without requiring hardware."
